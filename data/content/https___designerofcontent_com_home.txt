Who This is For
Let's be real—
running a small business is no joke
. I know this because I
am
a small business, right here in the trenches with you. That's exactly why Designer of Content exists—to make
marketing, lead generation, and automation way easier for fellow small business owners
who are tired of juggling all the hats.
I see you, travel agents trying to keep up with inquiries and follow-ups while also building dreamy vacations. I see you, salon owners handling appointments, Instagram posts, and inventory all before your first coffee. And I see you, realtors trying to stand out in a sea of listings while keeping every client happy and informed.
You're my people.
I know firsthand how hard it is to balance creativity, customer service, and actually growing your business. That's why everything I create is built to
save you time, bring you leads, and make you look like a total pro

"I wasn't sure what to expect when I submitted my dream, but WOW—I'm blown away by how accurate and insightful this analysis was! It really made me reflect on the deeper meaning behind my dream, and I have to admit, it nailed a lot of things I hadn't even considered. The way it broke down each part—the tree stump, the water slides, my grandparents, the family gathering—it all made perfect sense.
What really stood out to me was how it connected my childhood fear with personal growth. I didn't realize how much this dream symbolized stepping out of my comfort zone, and now, looking back, I can see how much I've changed. The part about my grandparents being there hit home, too.
This analysis wasn't just fun—it was meaningful. If you're on the fence about trying this, do it. You might learn more about yourself than you expected!"

Example of an automation I created
The Perfect Sales Funnel!
A sales funnel is the
path your potential customers follow
from the moment they discover you to the point where they make a purchase (or book a service). It starts by grabbing their attention—usually with something valuable like a
free checklist, quiz, or guide
. From there, you nurture them with helpful content, follow-ups, and offers that build trust and show your expertise. Finally, the funnel guides them to take action, whether that's booking a consultation, purchasing a product, or signing up for your service. A
well-designed funnel works for you 24/7
, capturing and converting leads automatically, so you can focus on running your business instead of constantly chasing down new clients.

How Designer of Content Helps Build the Perfect Funnel
A great sales funnel needs
the right tools at every step
—and that's exactly what Designer of Content delivers. From eye-catching lead magnets that grab attention, to
pre-written follow-up emails
and ready-to-use automation workflows, everything you need to
guide potential clients from curious to committed
is right at your fingertips. Whether you're capturing leads with a fun quiz, nurturing them with value-packed content, or sending smart follow-ups, our tools help you build a funnel that works for you—even when you're off the clock.
